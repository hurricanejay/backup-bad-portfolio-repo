<h1>THIS IS A MINOR CHANGE</h1>
                            <p>I am a full stack software engineer with a passion for beautiful design and functionality.</p>
                            <p>From a young age I was always fussing around with websites blogging (Blogger, Tumblr) or updating my Myspace. 
                                It wasn't until many years later that I re-discovered my passion for the creating things on the interwebz. 
                                After a couple of months of self learning, I decided I wanted to formally learn programming so I enrolled in Flatiron School and graduated in April 2020.</p>

                            <p>Prior to my career transition, I worked as a website and marketing manager for a start-up jewelry company and in media as a photographer, producer and talent. I'm looking for new opportunities that will allow me to combine my new technical skills and creativity to create something people can easily use.</p>
